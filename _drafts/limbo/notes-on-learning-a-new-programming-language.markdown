As part of my personal set of goals and career development I'm always trying to learn something new that relates to my field of work, a new framework, technology or programming language. When talking about programming languages I've never had a particular problem picking a new one. 

Early in my career I started with C++ and Java eventually switching over to PHP and (mostly) settling down for the last 6 years; over that period I have toyed with a fair share of languages each time. 

Each time I've followed the standard process tutorials, screencasts, etc. and as many other developers each time I get mixed results sometimes things are really easy to pick up and understand, sometimes ... not so much. Over the last month or so I started looking into something completely different from what I'm used to, a functional programming language called **Elixir**.

Now, this is not the first time I've tried to learn a functional language; in the past I tried learning Haskell and Scala with very poor results; this time I'm determined to succeed and in order to do so I'm rethinking my approach.

The way we learn programming languages is fundamentally flawed, by that mean we focus on memorizing syntaxtical flavours first and on the language philosophy and **raison d'Ãªtre** second; I argue that we should focus on the opposite and approach languange learning from a philosophical approach first. 

Now, I do realize that using the word philosophical might seem off-putting anr maybe a bit snobbish; but think about it, the majority of programming languages have been creating with a particular purpose in mind from C origins being closely tied to the UNIX operating system development, Erlang being specifically designed to improve telephony applications to Ruby being born of authors need for a genuine object-oriented scripting language.
