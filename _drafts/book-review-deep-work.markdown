Focus, an increasingly scarce resource; seems that now days our attention and energy are more and more dispersed, consumed by social media feeds, emails, slack conversations and ad-hoc 5 minute questions.

As consequence our capacity to produce meaninful, valuable and challenging work has greatly decreased; and is with this premise that Cal Newport start his book, Deep Work – Rule for focused success in a distracted work. 

Few productivity books have resonated as strongly as this one in my entirely life, Professor Newport starts by walking us through the general concept and premise of what he calls **Deep Work**

Deep work is nothing more than high quality work produced by highly focused and long sessions of work; and Professor Newport attributes the following characteristis to Deep Work:

- Deep Work is valuable
- Deep Work is rare
- Deep Work is meaningful

Let that one sink for a second, work that is valuable, rare and meaningful; work that in its very essence pushes us to the borders of our cognitive capacity. Personally, Deep Work is what I found enticing about being a software engineer, that ability to sit down for hours on end with laser focus breaking down a particular problem.

While reading the book I came to a sad realization, over the last year and a half; I had slowly moved away from the kind of work (Deep work) that I find trully meaningful and fulfilling, as replacement my days are now filled with meetings, constant interruptions coming from 'Quick Questions', emails, twitter, facebook, or slack. 

By the first half of the book it became clear to me why I had this nagging feeling that 2016 was such unproductive, and unsatisfactory year; I had been trapped into the Shallows – Cal uses this term to refer to the mindless shallow work
