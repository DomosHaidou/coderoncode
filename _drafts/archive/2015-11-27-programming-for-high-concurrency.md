# Programming for High Concurrency

Having just gone through the mental and physical rollercoaster that managing e-commerce websites during **Black Friday** imposes on sysadmins and developers alike; I found myself rethinking how we currently approach commerce.

When thinking about the process from an outsider perspective there are some things that look truly asinine. The over-reliance on caching and indexes in order to handle the increase in traffic and the resulting load.

How would ecommerce look like of concurrency was no longer a cause of concern or a limiting factor?

Would ecommerce change if merchants where able to push new products, update prices and and run promotions at any time no matter how many users on the site?

<!-- Draft
I just went through one of the most stressful time periods of the year —at least for a developer/sysadmin like myself— Black-Friday and Cyber-Monday.  

With the holiday season deals there might also come massive outburst of traffic and the challenge to manage such traffic spikes. Often than not we relay on heavier, so called last minute 'optimizations', or even throwing more hardware at the problem.

And while this might be all well and good to get us out of a pinch, as developers we are tip-toeing around the problem; our languange/framework/stack is simply not able to keep up with the level of concurrency during this times. -->
