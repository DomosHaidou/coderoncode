# What is PHPSpec?

<blockquote>
PHPSpec is a development tool, designed to help you achieve clean and working
PHP code by using a technique derived from Test Driven Development (TDD) called
Spec Behaviour Driven Development (SpecBDD).
</blockquote>

{% excerpt %}
With PHPSpec we describe the behaviour of an object public API, and test against
that; making sure that the object meets our specifications.
