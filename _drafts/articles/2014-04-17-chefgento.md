One of the many challenges that Web developers face in this day and age is the developing and testing applications across a wide range of multiple platforms. 
Properly setting up and creating virtual environments can be at times difficult and time consuming. But thanks to Vagrant not anymore.

## What is Vagrant

Vagrant is a tool for building complete development environments with focus on portability and automation. In fewer words Vagrant is awesome.

Not all developers have the skill nor the time for setting up development environments for each project, installing and setting a full lamp stack each time or maybe testing an application across different environments; doing this by hand each time, it's just waste full.
