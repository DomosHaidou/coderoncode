<!-- Notes: 

How well do cloud solutions like digital ocean and aws compare against bare metal server hosted in data centers?

What is the best choice for a Magento merchant looking to upgrade or setup a new infrastructure?

Which solution is superior? Neither is.

The important conclusion this article should communicate is that each solution is better suited to satisfy different
