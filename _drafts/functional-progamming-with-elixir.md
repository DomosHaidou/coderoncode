Recently, I've been looking into new languages and particularly into different programming paradigms. **Functional programming** has been a topic of interest for me for a couple years now, but until know I haven't been able to fully dive in into it.

After many failed starts over the years, I finally found a functional language that has been able to capture my interest and so far has kept me hooked trying to learn as much as I can, that language is called **Elixir**.

## Why functional programming?

Why should I care about functional programming? You might ask, after all Object Oriented Programming is the paradigm of choice, and anything else must be a subpar solution, right?

Well, while it might be true that OOP is the current dominant paradigm, there are also several drawbacks and problems to it:

  - OOP can be bug prone; due to date mutability and ever-changing state.
  - Due to the level of high level of abstraction used in Object Oriented Programming, resulting software can be larger and slower to run.
  - Difficult to support multithreading.
