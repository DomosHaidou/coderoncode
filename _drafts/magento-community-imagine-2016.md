# Magento Imagine 2016

With only a few days until the official start of Magento Imagine 2016 and all the announcements, events and noise that comes with I want to take a quick detour and talk about the community.

Yes, the Magento community again; if you follow the Magento ecosystem the word community gets thrown out a lot, we love talking about the community and for a very good reason; the community is the life blood of Magento. 

Life blood? Really? Yes really, it might sound ridiculous but a great deal of the success that Magento has had in the past is due to its community.

It's the community that it's constantly pushing Magento both the company and the platform; developing solutions around it, creating a strong ecosystem and overall recommending and using the platform.

I strongly believe that without the strength of this community and all the amazing people that form it that Magento could have grown as large and as successful as it has in past.

Now, Magento has been good at recognizing its community and the value they add, more so in recent years, and if that's the case why I'm bring the subject yet again?

Well, it simple its all about Magento2.
