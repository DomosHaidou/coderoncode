##Notes from James Cowie conversation

While talking with James Cowie this morning he mentioned how Magento developers are not really familiar with even basic concepts of the PHP Language, like interfaces or more generic PHP tools like composer. 

This represents a problem for the transition of developers from Magento1 to Magento2, right now there is this invicible wall of knowledge that might prevent 'Magento Developers' from smoothly transitioning into Magento2.

While is can be a significant problem for the Magento community, it also presents an opportunity for Magecasts.io and myself; where we could easily generate enough content to achieve the following:

- Evangelize on the improvements of Magento2
- Help the community to transition
- Bridge the Gap between the Magento community and the PHP Community

It also opens the doors for commercialization and an additional channel of income, depending on how well we can plan this.

## Passive income building

How can I use the content and knowdlegde that I'm generating in order to generate more passive income.

Currently the "Magento Developers Guide" doesn't produce enough content for me to call it a source of income, right now it average around $200 every month
