<!-- you will kill people, insert scene from either a medical doctor speech or house -->

Software is eating the world, embedding itself deeper into our infrastructure, banking systems, the internet of things and even healtcare. As someone that has developed software professionally for more than a decade I find that idea both exhalirating, deeply troubling, and dare I say alright scary.

No matter where you look, or what you do software is likely to be involved in one way or another from traffic lights, to planes, to even your coffee machine; for lack of a better term we are sourunded. 

Now, please don't misunderstand me as I mentioned I'm a professional software engineer I have done my fair share of writing that code, in truth I have no problem with the software itself, what deeply troubles me is how that software was developed, how is mantained and above all how for most cases no one, and I mean absolutely no one fully understands how it works. 

"Hyperbole!" — I hear some of you screaming — "The software was writen by someone, so obviously understand how it works." Well here is one of the dirty secrets of software engineering, not even the developer that wrote the program really understands its inner workings and more importantly its pitfalls in full, not really they might have a good idea, but not 100% certainty ... well unless we are talking of fairly simple programs. 

Software development is deeply broken, at it's core the way we develop and think about software is flawed. Let's do a quick recap of the origins of software development.

<!-- Insert brief breakdown of modern software development-->

And here there lies the problem, the complexity combined with the levels of abstraction make it impossible for a developer to keep the entire program in his head there is simply too much happening. 

Let's go over some examples:

<!-- Insert information about the TOYOTA acceleration bug and aftermath -->

<!-- Software bugs from NASA -->

<!-- Software bugs on medical devices like pacemakers or pumps -->

Now it's been a while since I went to school, but I don't recall my CS professor giving a lecture on how my software could potentially kill people. Is just not something that we want to acknowledge and think about. We also refuse to acknowledge that the way we do and teach programming might be fundamentally broken. 

Software developers tend to think themselves as artisans or craftsmans; and there is nothing wrong about taking pride in one's work and profession but when was the last time you saw an Airbus being build by hand, or got an artisanal peacemaker; now think about the software running both of those things ... how does the statement "The software in my pacemaker was made by a code craftsman", not very reassuring right?

But what else is there what other paradigms or tools can software developers use to build software.
