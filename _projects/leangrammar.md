#LeanGrammar.com

Grammar, spelling checker geared towards Leanpub.com authors.

- Github support/login integration
- Magentolite powered
- Uses Languagetool.org to do the grammar check.
- Presents results as a report (a la triplecheck)
- Branch and commit corrections as a pull request (phase2)
- Support for Editor review (starting $100) (phase2)

### Budget:

60 hours = $9000CAD (assuming $150hr)

Ideally I should be able to deliver way under budget; since I don't have to implement any of the grammar checking functionality. 

The tricky part here might be the multitenancy, I can use stripe for billing. Should I do an MVP? 

I think dogfooding this for myself would be the ideal scenario, since I'm also a leanpub author, I can give myself a 100% discount on stripe and that way test the full functionality.
