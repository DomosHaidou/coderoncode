# Series Plan: Neural Networks and AI

## What's the problem I'm trying to solve?

- Understanding Neural Networks
- Using Machine learning without a PhD 
- Neural networks without math


Reading the Handbook of Neural Evolution got me motivated to mash up two of my current interests Elixir and Neural Networks,into a blog series.

Before jumping into more advance concepts there has to be some introduction to the essential terminology and language. 

Roughly the post should be devided as follows:

- Introduction to the Series
- Beginner: What are Neural Networks?
- Beginner: Creating a Single Neuron in Elixir
- Beginner: Multi-Neuron Networks in Elixir


## Titles
