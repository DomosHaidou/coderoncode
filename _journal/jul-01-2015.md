Last night I started tracking our finances with mint.com (finally got it working) seems in the last couple months our spending has been a bit out of whack. Fortunately, this can be easily solved by simply controlling resturants and groceries spending.

Looking at my income and finances in a condenced way, made me think about my passive income and see what I can do to updated/increase it. 

Releasing the books and booklets will certainly help, but there is a high initial level of effort and their lifetime is relatively short.

# Passive income 

### Long term product ideas

**Leangrammar.com:** Automated grammar checking for leanpub authors.
- Revenue type: Subscriptions
- Inital cost: Medium-high, development cost and hosting.

**Sensualmachines.com:** Sextoys review website. 
- Revenue type: Adds and referrals
- Inital cost: Low, content generation could potentially add a lot to it. 

This combined with the income from the books, could potentially supplement my income nicely.


## Current side project costs

I have started many side projects, websites, etc. That are right now not adding any revenue and just adding cost; into that monthly cost I have to factor in:

- Domain renewals
- Hosting costs (DigitalOcean and Linode)
- Github private repositories
- Templates, layouts, etc.
- Time spend
