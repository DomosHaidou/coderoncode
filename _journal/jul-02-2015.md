Yesterday I spend time researching ideas for possible passive income sources:

- Niche Sites:
    - Mechanical Keyboards
    - Nootropic Research
    - Nootropic News
    - Nootropic Reviews
    - Ecgirrate Related
- Curated Content sites 
    - Videos 
        - Creepypasta vidos
        - Product Reviews
    - Articles
        - Technology
        - Finaces
- Selling Software prototypes for freelancers:
    - Freelanceblueprints.com
    - Phpblueprints.com

Before Starting anything I need to put all domains in a landing page that I can track with GA.
