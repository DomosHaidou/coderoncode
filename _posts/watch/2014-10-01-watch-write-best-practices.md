What to watch this week, **Lauren Rother** from [PuppetLabs](http://puppetlabs.com/) give us their best practices to write best practices. A great set of recommendations for
writing and mantaining your best practice documentation.



> Writing best practices documentation is definitely an art, but that doesn't mean a little science can't help us along. Through some trial and
> error, I've uncovered some tenets of writing engaging, readable best practices docs. I'll walk through a bit of my path to discovery as I highlight
> and give examples of successful and (enthusiastic) reader-approved best practices documents.
