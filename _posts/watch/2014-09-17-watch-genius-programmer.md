What to watch this week, In this week video **Brian Fitzpatrick** and **Ben Collins-sussman** talk about the pervasive myth of the uber-programmer the
know it all genius; why everyone secretly wants to be considerad a genius and how this can affect the collaboration and behavior. 



> A pervasive elitism hovers in the background of collaborative software development: everyone secretly wants to be seen as a genius. In this talk,
> we discuss how to avoid this trap and gracefully exchange personal ego for personal growth and super-charged collaboration. We'll also examine how
> software tools affect social behaviors, and how to successfully manage the growth of new ideas.
